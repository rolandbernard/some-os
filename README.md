Some OS
=======

This is just a simple operating system for RISC-V rv64gc targets. It is not intended to actually be
used.

## Development

Compile the project using the `make` command, and execute the resulting binary with qemu using the
`make qemu` command. You will need to install a version of Clang that includes riscv64 support.
